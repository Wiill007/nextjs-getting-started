# CSS-Styling
3 partes importantes del desarrollo del css en este tipo de proyectos:
1. Global styles
2. Tailwind
3. CSS Modules
4. Clsx Library

## Global Styles
If you look inside the /app/ui folder, you'll see a file called global.css. You can use this file to add CSS rules to all the routes in your application - such as CSS reset rules, site-wide styles for HTML elements like links, and more.

Add global styles to your application by navigating to /app/layout.tsx and importing the global.css file:

## Tailwind
Tailwind is a CSS framework that speeds up the development process by allowing you to quickly write utility classes directly in your TSX markup.

Although the CSS styles are shared globally, each class is singularly applied to each element. This means if you add or delete an element, you don't have to worry about maintaining separate stylesheets, style collisions, or the size of your CSS bundle growing as your application scales.
```js
<main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col p-6">
```

## CSS Modules
CSS Modules allow you to scope CSS to a component by automatically creating unique class names, so you don't have to worry about style collisions as well.

We can create .module.css files inside the ui folder as we want and then we can use for example the following:
```js
import styles from '@/app/ui/home.module.css';

<div className={styles.shape} />
```

## Clsx Library
clsx is a library that lets you toggle class names easily. For example:
```js
import clsx from 'clsx';
 
export default function InvoiceStatus({ status }: { status: string }) {
  return (
    <span
      className={clsx(
        'inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm',
        {
          'bg-gray-100 text-gray-500': status === 'pending',
          'bg-green-500 text-white': status === 'paid',
        },
      )}
    >
    // ...
)}
```
