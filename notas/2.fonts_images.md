# [Fonts and images](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/optimizing-fonts-images)

En esta parte del tutorial se enseña cómo añadir fuentes e imágenes. Una nota sobre las imágenes para separarlas en móviles y desktops:

The magic happens thanks to the `className` prop and the use of Tailwind CSS utility classes.

Here's a breakdown:

* `className="hidden md:block"` on the first image:
	+ `hidden` means the image is hidden by default.
	+ `md:block` means that on medium-sized screens and above (`md` breakpoint), the image will be displayed as a block element.
* `className="block md:hidden"` on the second image:
	+ `block` means the image is displayed as a block element by default.
	+ `md:hidden` means that on medium-sized screens and above (`md` breakpoint), the image will be hidden.

In Tailwind CSS, the `md` breakpoint is set to a minimum width of 768px by default. This means that:

* On small screens (e.g., mobile devices with a width < 768px), the first image is hidden, and the second image is displayed.
* On medium-sized screens and above (e.g., tablets, laptops, and desktops with a width ≥ 768px), the first image is displayed, and the second image is hidden.

By using these utility classes, you can easily show different images for different devices without writing custom media queries or JavaScript code.

Note that you can adjust the breakpoint values in your `tailwind.config.js` file if needed.
